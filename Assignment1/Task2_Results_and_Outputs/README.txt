The entire code for the task 1 is attached in NLP_Part2.ipynb and in files preset in Doc2Vec code folder
STEPS TO RUN THE CODE:
1. open the NLP_Part2.ipynb through jupiter Notebook or Google colab. 
2. Run the pre-written code for associated input files cell by cell to view the output.
3. code headings for each subpart of the assignment is provided for better understanding.
4. Once Cosine similarities values are obtained for each model, their values are appended in a text file for each of the Input file.
 [example: within Doc2Vec folder you'll find 5 txt files for STS2016.input.answer-answer.txt, STS2016.input.headlines.txt, STS2016.input.plagiarism.txt
STS2016.input.postediting.txt, STS2016.input.question-question.txt input files]. Same is followed for other models too. 
6. Using these files and Gold Standard Files[STS2016.gs.answer-answer.txt, STS2016.gs.headlines.txt, STS2016.gs.plagiarism.txt, STS2016.gs.postediting.txt, STS2016.gs.question-question.txt]

we have used correlation-noconfidence.pl to find the values.
