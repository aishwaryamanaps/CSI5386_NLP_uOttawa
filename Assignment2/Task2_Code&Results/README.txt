The entire code for the task 2 is attached in NLP_Assignment2_Task2.ipynb and in files preset in Doc2Vec code folder
STEPS TO RUN THE CODE:
1. open the NLP_Assignment2_Task2.ipynb through jupiter Notebook or Google colab. 
2. Run the pre-written code for associated input files cell by cell to view the output.
3. code headings for each subpart of the assignment is provided for better understanding.
4. Once Cosine similarities values are obtained for each model, their values are appended in a text file for each of the Input file.
We have used correlation-noconfidence.pl to find the values.
